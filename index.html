                            <p>Violin-Bot_Player is an innovative and programmable machine that masterfully plays the violin. Its design focuses on optimizing both the bowing and fingering systems. Various approaches were evaluated to achieve a smooth and harmonious bowing technique, culminating in a design that produces a rich, expressive sound. Similarly, the fingering system employs an array of push-type solenoids that mimic the delicate touch of a skilled violinist. With fixed distances maintained between solenoids to ensure accuracy, the entire configuration can shift seamlessly along the fingerboard to articulate intermediary notes, effectively covering at least the first full octave on each string.</p>

                             <p>The PHYSIBALL is a fully functional, wireless tennis-ball-size that transmits and visualizes data in real-time.</p>
                             <p>Battery-powered for mobility or USB-connected for analysis, it can also function as an active sensor in other equipment.</p>
                             <p>The system outputs raw data, calibrated measurements, or yaw/pitch/roll values with customizable visualization graphs (size, quantity, colors).</p>
                             <p>Using Jeenode modules instead of Bluetooth eliminates pairing requirements, enhancing communication reliability.</p>
                             <p>Testing revealed signal integrity up to 30 meters indoors, even through walls and amid electronic interference.</p>
